 * what part of the compilation shuld avoid the test files 
        -   there is a test container, dev container, build container, and prod container,
        the test container compile the logic and tests and run the tests, the dev container 
        also compile them both but run test only if commanded, the build container (or through
        the dev container command), will run tsc with a production tsConfig file the will
        not compile test (and not dev dependecies, set appropriate environment variables, and more..)


run : 

in production
-------------
    so there is a cluster running in the cloud, getting http requests 
    from a cloudFront/cloundFlare to an ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


in local development
-------------
    so there is a cluster running locally getting requests from postman/ngrok/browser throw custom host
    a ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


in cloud development
-------------
    so there is a a cluster and a replica cluster for dev, both running in the cloud, 
    skaffold sync files from the local machine / rebuild image from the local machine to docker hub and rebuild the pod from that image , 
    getting http requests from a cloudFront/cloundFlare to an ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express



in hybrid development (only the the one service being developed run's locally)
-------------
    so there is a a cluster and a replica cluster for dev, both running in the cloud, 
    option 1)   the cluster considering the local machine as part of the resource grop and the deployment of the 
                pod being developed run's locally, snd skaffold do its thing locally (no need to go through docker hub)
    option 2)   the event bus just sends https requests to the serviec running locally like any other external resource
    option 3)   maybe k8s have some out of the box solution for



    so there is a cluster running locally getting requests from postman/ngrok/browser throw custom host
    a ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


what being part of the cluster give to a deployment
1. it gets the compute power it's nedded
2. it can get 
3. it gets reloded
4. insted of having public ip for every running container, only the cluster gets a public ip. 
    then ther is ingresses reciving the reqest snd redirect's all of them by http header 'host name' to clusterIP services
    then
